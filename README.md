[00:19.13] Been a lot of places
[00:21.03] I've been all around the world
[00:24.03] Seen a lot of faces
[00:26.28] Never knowing where I was
[00:29.16] On the horizon
[00:31.69] Hmm, well I know, I know, I know, I know
[00:33.95] The sun will be rising back home
[00:49.95] 
[00:39.79] Living out of cases
[00:42.27] And packing up and taking off
[00:44.78] Made a lot of changes
[00:47.38] But not forgetting who I was
[00:49.91] On the horizon
[00:52.44] Ooh, well I know, I know, I know, I know
[00:55.38] The moon will be rising back home
[01:11.88] 
[00:59.67] Don't forget where you belong, home
[01:05.16] Don't forget where you belong, home
[01:10.62] If you ever feel alone, don't
[01:15.74] You were never on your own
[01:18.93] And the proof is in this song
[01:33.43] 
[01:26.38] I've been away for ages
[01:29.11] But I got everything I need
[01:31.55] I'm flicking through the pages
[01:34.48] I've written in my memory
[01:37.24] I feel like I'm dreaming
[01:39.50] Oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
[01:42.05] That I'm never leaving
[01:44.57] No, I won't go
[01:51.57] 
[01:47.11] Don't forget where you belong, home
[01:52.58] Don't forget where you belong, home
[01:57.77] If you ever feel alone, don't
[02:02.79] You were never on your own
[02:05.51] And the proof is in this song
[02:20.01] 
[02:09.30] Lights off when they should be on
[02:11.72] Even stars in the skies, they're wrong
[02:14.69] Short days when the nights are long
[02:16.86] When I think of the things I've done
[02:19.62] Don't matter how far I've gone
[02:22.04] I'm always free to run home
[02:35.54] 
[02:28.85] Don't forget where you belong, home
[02:33.91] Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home
[02:39.22] If you ever feel alone, don't
[02:44.34] You were never on your own
[02:46.11] Never, never, never
[02:55.61] 
[02:49.64] Don't forget where you belong, home
[02:54.62] Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home
[02:59.67] If you ever feel alone, don't
[03:05.22] You were never on your own (you were never)
[03:08.34] And the proof is in this song
[03:22.84] 
[03:14.02] Home
[03:17.44] Don't forget it
[03:18.41] Home
[03:20.65] If you ever feel alone, don't
[03:25.58] You were never on your own (you were never)
[03:29.41] And the proof is in this song
[03:43.91] 
[03:36.29] Never forget it, this song (don't forget it)
[03:44.49] No, I'll never forget it, this song (you were never)
