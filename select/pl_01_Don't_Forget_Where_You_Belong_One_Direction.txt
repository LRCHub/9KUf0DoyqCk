Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon
Well I know, I know,
I know, I know
The sun will be rising
Back home
Living out of cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon
I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising
Back home
Don't forget where you belong,
home
Don't forget where you belong,
home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Been away for ages
But I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming
So I know, I know,
I know, I know
That I'm never leaving
No, I won't go
Don't forget where you belong,
home
Don't forget where you belong,
home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Lights off when they
should be on
Even stars in the
sky look wrong
Short days but the
lights are long
When I think of the
things I've done
Don't matter how I've gone
I'm always free to run home
Don't forget where you belong,
home
Don't forget where you belong,
home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own
Never, never, never
Don't forget where you belong,
home
Don't forget where you belong,
home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Home
Don't forget it
Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You are never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Never forget it
This song (Don't forget it)
No I'll never forget it
This song (You will never)
